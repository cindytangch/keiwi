# Keiwi

_Keiwi_ is a card game that blends strategy, simulation, and role-play to explore personal data collection and usage. Designed for three to four players, the game includes 4 rule leaflets, 60 cards, and 108 tokens representing personal data. The deck consists of four types of cards: _Action_, _Activity_, _Application_, and _Mission_.

Players take on dual roles, developing _Applications_ to attract users while also using others’ _Applications_ to complete _Missions_ and earn points. Using an _Application_ requires sharing personal _Data_, which can then be collected to upgrade _Applications_ for additional points. At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins. In parallel, _Activity_ cards offer an alternative way to complete missions without data sharing but take more time, while _Action_ cards leverage GDPR laws to protect players’ data rights.

The first game session lasts about 30 minutes, including time for players to integrate the rules, while subsequent sessions take approximately 15 minutes. Primarily designed as an educational tool for high school students, the game aims to encourage discussions on personal data economy issues in classroom settings. However, it can also be adapted for a broader audience.
